RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Press any key to start the game. Use the spray repellant to repel the bugs
from the flowers. When a bug lands on a flower, he will "suck" the flower
and make it droop. If the flower droops too much, the flower will disappear. 
In later levels, bees will arrive to help the flowers grow. Avoid hitting the
bees with the repellant, or they'll run away for that level. With each new
level, the player gets an additional 5 sprays for each living flower.
The game ends when there are no more flowers to protect.
